To enter a new note, add a title and the body of the note. When you're ready, click the save button. The note will be added to your saved notes. You can review your notes by clicking the title in the sidebar. If you'd like to remove a note simply click the trashcan icon. Notes are stored on the server in Heroku so they'll persist on refresh or between devices.
